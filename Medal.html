<h2> Medals</h2>

<p>If you complete a level, you get a silver medal. The number inside the medal is the number of moves you needed to complete the level. If you complete a level in a minimal number of moves, you will get a golden medal.</p>

<p>From Level 2 and onwards, you can get two different medals for a level: one for using all available tools, and another for using only the primitive tools available on Level 1.
