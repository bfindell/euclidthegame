<h2> Medals</h2>

<p>If you complete a level, you get a silver medal. The number inside the medal is the number of moves you needed to complete the level. If you complete a level in a minimal number of moves, you will get a golden medal.</p>

<p>From Level 2 and onwards, you can get two different medals for a level: one for using all available tools, and another for using only the primitive tools available on Level 1. 
</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>

<ul>
<li> Esc | Cancel current move</li>
<li> Ctrl+Z | undo</li>
<li> Crtl+Y | redo</li>
</ul>

<h2>Levels</h2>

<ul>
<li> Levels 1-12 build the toolbar and serve as an introduction to GeoGebra</li>
<li> Levels 13-18 pose typical construction problems for school mathematics</li>
<li> Levels 19-25 provide more advanced constructions, some of which are quite challenging</li>
<li> Levels 26-28 illustrate triangle congruence criteria</li>
<li> Levels 29-32 develop basic rigid motions and dilation</li>
<li> Level 33 recreates Euclid's Proposition 2, which "builds" a (non-collapsing) compass</li>
</ul>
