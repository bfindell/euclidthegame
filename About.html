<h2>Levels</h2>
Complete the Tutorial and Levels 1-12 to reveal later levels.  
<ul>
<li> Levels 1-12 build the toolbar and serve as an introduction to GeoGebra</li>
<li> Levels 13-18 pose typical construction problems for school mathematics</li>
<li> Levels 19-25 provide more advanced constructions, some of which are quite challenging</li>
<li> Levels 26-28 illustrate triangle congruence criteria</li>
<li> Levels 29-32 develop basic rigid motions and dilation</li>
<li> Level 33 recreates Euclid's Proposition 2, which "builds" a (non-collapsing) compass</li>
</ul>

<h2>Controls</h2>
<ul>
<li> Tools on the toolbar </li>   
<li> Undo and redo arrows, upper right </li>
</ul>

<h2>Medals</h2>

<p>If you complete a level, you receive a silver medal. The number inside the medal is the number of moves you used to complete the level. If you complete a level in a minimal number of moves, you receive a golden medal.</p>

<p>From Level 2 and onwards, you can get two different medals for a level: one for using all available tools, and another for using only the primitive tools available on Level 1.

<h2>About</h2>
<p>Kasper Peulen's brilliant game has been borrowed and rehosted here at <a href="http://euclid.findell.org">http://euclid.findell.org</a>.&nbsp We have squashed bugs, edited the text and sketches, improved the <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/">GeoGebra</a> functionality, and added new levels!  Please report bugs and send suggestions to <a href="mailto:bfindell@gmail.com">Brad Findell</a>.</p>
